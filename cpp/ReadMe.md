# This program is an implementation of the algorithm in the following paper
# to prove that Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture is true for graphs without long induced paths.
# Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture says that a graph with minimum degree three has a cycle of 
# length a power of two.
# <todo: add the paper link>
